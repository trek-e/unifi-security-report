# Phase 4: Report Generation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Transform findings into professionally formatted, human-readable reports. Generates both HTML and plain text formats. Reports present findings organized by severity with executive summaries. Delivery (email, file output) and scheduling are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Report Structure
- **Organization**: Severity first — SEVERE section, then MEDIUM, then LOW
- **Executive summary**: Include counts AND highlights (actionable issues only — those with remediation)
- **LOW severity treatment**: Collapsed by default in HTML (click to expand); plain text shows all

### Content Depth
- **Detail level by severity**:
  - SEVERE: Full detail (title, full description, occurrence info, full remediation steps)
  - MEDIUM: Summary (title, brief description, occurrence info, remediation)
  - LOW: One-liner (title and occurrence count only)
- **Recurring issues**: Visual [Recurring] badge only, no special callout box
- **Remediation format**: Numbered steps (1. 2. 3.)

### HTML Styling
- **Visual style**: UniFi-inspired — match UniFi controller colors (blue accents, modern UI)
- **Severity indicators**: Subtle colored badges/pills next to titles (red SEVERE, orange MEDIUM, gray LOW)
- **CSS approach**: Self-contained with inline CSS (works in email, single file)
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-responsive (adapts to phone/tablet screens)

### Branding & Headers
- **Report title**: Configurable via settings (default: "UniFi Network Report")
- **Network name**: Auto-detect from UniFi controller if available
- **Timestamps**: Show both period covered AND generated time (e.g., "Covering: Jan 20-24 | Generated: Jan 24 at 3:00 PM")
- **Footer**: Minimal — just "Generated by UniFi Scanner"

### Claude's Discretion
- Whether to include links to UniFi controller device pages
- Exact UniFi color palette matching
- Collapsible section implementation details
- Plain text formatting for tiered detail levels

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- UniFi controller has a distinctive blue (#0559C9) and clean modern aesthetic to match
- Executive summary should help someone quickly understand "do I need to act on this?"
- Collapsing LOW findings keeps focus on what matters while preserving the information
