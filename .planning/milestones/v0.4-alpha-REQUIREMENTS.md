# Requirements: UniFi Scanner

**Defined:** 2026-01-24
**Core Value:** Translate cryptic UniFi logs into understandable findings with actionable remediation steps for serious issues

## v0.4-alpha Requirements

Requirements for extended analysis rules and optional integrations milestone.

### Integration Infrastructure

- [x] **INTG-01**: Service supports optional integrations that gracefully skip if not configured
- [x] **INTG-02**: Service isolates integration failures (one failing doesn't break others)
- [x] **INTG-03**: Service implements circuit breakers for external API calls

### Cybersecure Integration (Optional)

### WebSocket Support

- [x] **WS-01**: Service connects to UniFi WebSocket endpoint after REST API authentication
- [x] **WS-02**: Service receives WiFi events (roaming, connections, disconnections) via WebSocket
- [x] **WS-03**: Service buffers WebSocket events and processes on report generation schedule
- [x] **WS-04**: Service gracefully falls back to REST API when WebSocket unavailable

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Advanced Wireless (v0.5+)
- **WIFI-07**: Interference pattern detection
- **WIFI-08**: Wireless survey recommendations

### Advanced Security (v0.5+)
- **SECR-06**: Threat intelligence enrichment (IP reputation lookup)
- **SECR-07**: Anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time alerting | v1 is periodic reports only |
| Automatic remediation | Recommendations only, no auto-fix |
| Multi-gateway support | v1 is single gateway |
| Custom rule creation UI | Users edit code if needed |
| Historical trend graphs | Reports are point-in-time; dashboard is v2 |

## Traceability
